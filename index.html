                    <h2>About Me</h2><br>
                    <p>I am suitable for the data analyst role because I have great computer skills such as Microsoft Office, especially Excel, Python and Anaconda, Mathematics and Statistics, SQL (MySQL, SQLite, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle SQL Developer), Tableau, Power BI. Business Concepts in IT and Web Development. I have a good understanding of computer hardware and networking technologies.
I have experience in data analytics during 1 year at a large retail chain and as one of my achievements, I can say that my research with one dairy brand and analysis of the results helps the company was able to profitably redistribute 10% of the relevant department in all stores of the retail chain. I also predicted the workload in a particular store by day of the week and month, which made it possible to correctly distribute the staffâ€™s work schedule and serve an average of 10 customers per hour at one checkout, regardless of the total number of customers in the store. On this position I perfectly honed my skills in working with SQL and databases, data analysis and visualization, and based on my research and analysis, important decisions were made both for a specific store and for the entire retail chain. 
In addition, I believe that my personal characteristics make me an ideal candidate for a role in data analysis. I am analytical thinker, a quick learner, persistent, and diligent. I consistently meet deadlines and work well under pressure. 
Regarding my achievements, I am a member of the Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society and was named to the College President's List for the Fall 2023 semester with a 4.0 GPA, and my GPA is still 4.0.

Data Analyst intern<br>

                            <li>Performed historical data analysis to calculate the average sales value of products over different time periods to predict future sales trends, enabling the store to optimize inventory management and import the required amount of products.</li>
                            <li>Efficiently prepared reports on purchase trends and foot traffic, optimizing staff scheduling and resources for superior customer service - averaging 10 customers per hour at each checkout, reducing wait time by 30%.</li>
