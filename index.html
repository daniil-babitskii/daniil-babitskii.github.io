                    <h2>About Me</h2><br>
                    <p>I am a dedicated Data Analyst with a strong focus on using data to drive business decisions. At Pokupochka Retail Chain, I leveraged SQL, Power BI, and Python to analyze customer behavior, leading to actionable insights for personalized marketing and stock optimization. My work resulted in reducing checkout wait times by 30% and reallocating 10% of shelf space to more profitable products.
                    I am currently pursuing a degree in Information Technology with a specialization in Data Analysis at Central Piedmont Community College, maintaining a 4.0 GPA. My academic achievements include being a member of the Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society and the President's List. Through my coursework and projects, I have honed my skills in data analysis, statistical methods, and programming.
                    One of my notable projects involved visualizing Tesla stock data trends to predict future performance. Another project analyzed the relationship between study time and academic performance, demonstrating my ability to present complex data in a clear and actionable manner.
